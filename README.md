## Welcome to Machine Learning World
Machine learning is a fast growing field and helping people from engineering, robotics, computer science, medicines back grounds. This page is dedicated to different machine learning projects that I have done so far and those which are on going.

## Projects
Here I will provide highlights of each the project and associated `github` link. Some of these projects are research project and some are course projects.

### LASSO Regression for Feature Selection
Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator or LASSO is a regression method, highly used in Machine learning community for determining important features when number of features are lot more than needed. We have solved LASSO regression problem using synthetic data that finds only 10 important features out of 80 given features that are required to predict correct targets reliably. In short, LASSO regression helps to obtain sparse solution whenever possible. Use have used popular coordinate descent algorithm to minimize the convex loss function of LASSO.

### Neural Network to Classify Iris Dataset
In this project we want to classify different species of Iris flowers from Iris-dataset. This data-set is highly nonlinear and hence can not be classified with linear classifier. We have introduced a three layer (1 input+ 1 hidden + 1 output) neural net which are fully connected to build the classifier. We have developed the model using PyTorch's `torch.nn` module. Our model was able to predict correct labels with 99% accuracy on test data. We have also computed *confusion* matrix to better visualize the prediction pattern of the model.

### Design of Neuro-Observer of Robots
In this project we synthesized a nonlinear system-state-observer for two single-input-single-output
nonlinear systems. We use neural network to capture nonlinearity of the observer. No linearity
with respect to the unknown system parameters is required for the designed observer. The observer
stability and boundedness of the state estimates and NN weights are proven. In order to show the
effectiveness of the proposed observer, two simulations are carried out. First we modeled NN based
observer for a single-link robot, rotating in vertical plane with two sets of example data sets to train
the NN embeded into the observer. The second observer is designed for Van der Pol oscillator. For
the single-link observer, tests are performed with no-noise training data set and with noisy dataset
as well. It has been observed that NN based observer learned more accurately and faster from the
no-noise data set as compared to noisy data set which leads to longer learning time. The github link for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/anirban-bot/Neuro-Observer-for-Dynamical-Systems)
